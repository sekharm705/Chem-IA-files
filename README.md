# Chem-IA-files
All the files that I used for experiment #2 of my Chemistry IA. 

The 3D shell files can be found in the '3D shell files' folder, and the code/hardware descriptions for the Arduino can be found in 'Arduino code + weight cell schematics'. All the code & models (with the exception of the HX711 library, which is not present in this folder), were created by me.
